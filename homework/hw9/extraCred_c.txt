The double Gauss curves do fit better. The smoothed data points fit the curve better as well, but at the cost of losing information.
However, the information lost is considered noise so maybe it is not that important. When you smooth twice the graph looks better and follows a more uniform curve. 
As you continue to smooth you loose more and more data but your curve looks closer to a continious function. The double Gauss does look better and works well enough.
